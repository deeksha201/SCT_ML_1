Project Title:
🏡 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
Project Description:
In this project, a Linear Regression model is developed to predict house prices by analyzing historical housing data. The project demonstrates key machine learning steps including data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. This project helps in understanding how linear regression can be applied to real-world regression problems in the real estate domain.
Key Highlights:
Data preprocessing and visualization
Feature analysis
Model training using Linear Regression
Prediction of house prices
Model evaluation using error metrics
